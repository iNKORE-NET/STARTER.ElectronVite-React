# Electron-Vite React Starter-Kit

This is a simple project to get you started with Electron and React. It uses Electron-Vite to manage the Electron app and vanilla JavaScript for the main interface.

All the technologies used in this project are:

- [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)

- [Electron Vite](https://electron-vite.org/)

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

- [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/)

- [React](https://react.dev/)

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you click the "Use this template" button on the top right of this page or click [here](). This will create a new repository with the same structure as this one.

Clone the repository to your local machine, locate to `packages/app-browser` and run the following commands:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

This will start the Electron app. You can now start developing your app.
